# Marvelmind Indoor GPS (Configuration and ROS 2)

## Introduction

[Marvelmind Indoor Navigation System](https://marvelmind.com/) is an indoor navigation system that
provides precise (Â±2cm) location data to vehicles. It can track moving objects via mobile beacons attached to them.
The system can be connected to the ArduPilot.

This repository provides a Docker container to facilitate ```Dashboard Application``` the necessary software for setting up and tuning the system. 

The repository also provides the ROS 2 package, which communicates with the modem to obtain the position of the ```hedgehog```, the moving part of the system located on the vehicle.

Note: Building and running are necessary steps to configure the system. Omit if the system is already configured.

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markusbuchholz/indoor_gps_ros2_interface.git

cd indoor_gps_ros2_interface/docker

sudo ./build.sh

```

## Run

```bash 


sudo ./run.sh

cd /home/src/x86

./dashboard_x86

```



## ROS 2 Interface

Upload the ```ros2``` folder of this repository to your workspace (```name_ws/src```)

```bash
colcon build

source install/source.bash

ros2 launch marvelmind_ros2 marvelmind_ros2.launch.py
```

ROS 2 topics:

```bash
/beacon_raw_distance
/beacons_pos_addressed
/hedgehog_imu_fusion
/hedgehog_imu_raw
/hedgehog_pos
/hedgehog_pos_addressed
/hedgehog_pos_ang
/hedgehog_quality
/hedgehog_telemetry
/marvelmind_user_data
/marvelmind_waypoint
```

## Python Interface

It is possible to communicate with the system using the Python3 interface. It is easy to capture the position of the moving beacon ```hedgehog``` using the following terminal commands.

```bash
cd marvelmind_python/src

python3 example.py

# expected output:
# Hedge 6: X: 15.489 m, Y: -9.779 m, Z: -2.073 m, Angle: 0 at time T: 2024-07-15 10:37:50-009
```
## Operation

Please take note of the following instructions:
- Ensure that the beacons are charged with POWER DIP switch OFF.
- Prior to operating, launch the ```Dashboard``` program with the modem connected to the PC. Verify that the system is operational, and then close the program.
- Review the example Python script to confirm the position readings of the ```Hedge mobile beacon```, and terminate the program.
- Run the ROS 2 interface.

## Communication troubleshooting

First, verify the working system using the ```dashboard``` program. Next, run the Python script. If this works, the ROS 2 pkg can be launched.

The USB port can be stuck.

Perform the following commands.

```bash
